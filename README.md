This is a NextJS Weather App using NextJS 13

## About this App

This is an application that pulls in an API from OpenWeather that displays the current weather conditions. The applicaiton was built using NextJS 13 and Tailwinds. What was most interesting about this was exploring the new features in NextJS like lazy loading the image. I chose this project not just because it was very visually appealing, but also because it was a simple way to use API's and key/values offered in the the Weather object.
